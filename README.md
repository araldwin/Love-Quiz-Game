## Purpose of the project
The purpose of this project is for Project #3(Python), this is part of me achieving the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). Besides it is another General Knowledge, Fun Trivia question quiz game project, it can provide additional knowledge for the User.

## User stories
As a user:
  - there must be a username input.
  - there should be a choice whether I'm ready to play or not.
  - I should have a choice to answer each question.
  - question number must be displayed.
  - the score of correct answer should be displayed.
  - if my answer is wrong, I should see the correct answer to the question.
  - every correct answer should increase my score.
